A heuristic technique for hyperpameter tuning of coding experience prediction using Stack Overflow posts 
In this study, a book recommendation system based on multi-label classification is proposed by leveraging the Stack Overflow corpus. To that end, an up-to-date Stack Overflow data set is analyzed to devise a labeling function comprising 21 programming languages. The specified books are presented to the users according to the manual examination performed for three development levels. For the five different classifiers, the proposed hyperparameter optimization method achieved a higher accuracy than the traditional ones. In the comparison, the proposed method claims a competitive time and memory consumption for traditional hyperparameter optimization methods along with a stable success in changing hyperparameter values.
